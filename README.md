# Data-Viz

My portfolio page for Telling Story with Data at CMU :)

# About me

Hello, it's Qing (she/her/hers). Currently, I am a Public Policy and Management Student.  
I love data journalism and will try to be a good story teller.  
In another life, I would've worked in a nature documentary crew or been an penguin üêß.  

# What I hope to learn

I aim to master everything about data visualization, like a wizard learning spells.   
My plan? To create my own projects. Picture this: transforming my month-long European escapade into a visual feast, mapping every espresso sipped and every city visited. 

# Portfolio

Here's the roadmap of my journey to becoming a cool data storyteller.
