# Comparison of different visualization methods

Table with coloring:    

Table with coloring is an effective method to display complex datasets in a manner that is immediately accessible to the audience. When dealing with multiple variables, such as different countries over various years, a colored table allows for quick comparison and analysis. The use of color gradients – in this case, ranging from orange to blue – serves as a visual guide. With this color coding, the audience can swiftly discern patterns and outliers: a quick glance across the table would highlight which countries have higher debt ratios during certain years.      

This method not only makes it easier to compare the relative debt levels across different countries but also helps in tracking the progression of debt levels for each country over time. The intensity of the color becomes an intuitive indicator of increase or decrease, where subtle shifts in shades can point to gradual changes, and stark contrasts can signal major economic events or shifts in policy.      


Country Comparison (Bar Chart):     

Country Comparison using Bar Charts is an intuitive approach to visualizing differences across nations, particularly effective for showcasing data like debt ratios that can be quantitatively measured and compared. By representing each country's debt as a bar, the length of which correlates with the magnitude of the debt ratio, it creates a straightforward visual hierarchy: longer bars mean higher debt ratios, and shorter bars indicate lower ones.    

For example, we can select 2019 and compare the debt levels of different countries. This view allows readers to see at a glance which countries had higher debt levels in 2019. Or if the time we choose is 2008, we can compare which country was most affected by the length of the bars.       


Bar Chart V.S. Table:     

- Tables are more compact and can contain more detailed information, which makes them suitable for reports or dashboard displays where viewers expect to take time to study and interpret the data.
- Bar charts are more visually impactful and are better suited for presentations or infographics where the goal is to convey information quickly and memorably.
- Interactivity can enhance both methods: tables can become sortable and filterable, while bar charts can include interactive elements like tooltips and clickable bars that can drill down for more information.


Time series analysis (line chart):        

This method is great for showing trends(the lines up and down) in data over time. Through the line chart, we can clearly see the changes in the ratio of government debt to GDP in various countries from 1995 to 2019. This view is particularly useful for analyzing long-term trends and cyclical fluctuations, such as observing how economic crises affect countries' debt levels.
