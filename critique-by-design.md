When selecting a data visualization for critique and redesign, I was drawn to this particular graphic because it represents a wealth of socio-economic data about retirement ages across various European countries, as indicated by the data from the OECD in 2020. The choice of colors to represent different retirement ages is a compelling aspect of the design, as it aims to convey complex data in a straightforward manner. However, this map also presents several opportunities for improvement. The similar hues for adjacent age categories can blend together, potentially causing confusion or misinterpretation of the data. Moreover, the inclusion of the EU-27 average age as a benchmark is useful, but its placement and prominence within the graphic might be optimized for better immediate understanding.

The rationale behind this visualization's critique and subsequent redesign is grounded in enhancing the clarity and accessibility of the information presented. The current design, while informative, may not sufficiently accommodate individuals with color vision deficiencies, and the small distinctions between shades could be lost on many viewers. In the redesign, I aim to address these issues by adopting a more distinct color palette, improving the visual hierarchy, and making the graphic more inclusive and understandable for a wider audience. The goal is to transform this visualization into a more effective tool for policymakers, economists, and the general public to grasp the retirement age landscape across Europe.


## Step 2: Critique Data Viz

**1. Usefulness: 6/10**
  * Data Labels: The map does not provide specific age labels for each country, requiring viewers to cross-reference the color key, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
  * Color Coding: The use of similar shades for consecutive ages makes it difficult to differentiate between them at a glance. This diminishes the map's effectiveness in conveying precise information quickly.
  * This visualization might score around a 6. It presents valuable data but could benefit significantly from design improvements that enhance readability, accessibility, and immediate comprehension.

**2. Completeness: 5/10**
 * Data Scope: The visualization provides data on the average effective labor market exit age, which is a specific and relevant piece of information for understanding retirement trends. However, it is unclear whether all European countries are included or just a selection, which can affect the completeness of the regional analysis.
 * Comparative Context: While it does compare the retirement ages to the EU-27 average, it doesn't provide any comparison to targets or norms outside of this group, such as OECD averages or the statutory retirement age versus the actual retirement age.
 * This visualization might score around a 5. It presents a single layer of data without historical context or additional data that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the retirement landscape. To improve its score, it could include time-series data, comparisons to retirement age norms, and other relevant socio-economic indicators.
  
**3. Perceptibility: 3/10**
 * Graph Type: The choice of a color-coded map is effective for showing geographical distributions and comparisons at a glance. However, the decision to use color to distinguish between retirement ages requires the viewer to distinguish between shades that are often quite similar, which is not optimal for quick or precise comprehension.
 * Color Selection: The visualization uses very similar colors for 61-years-old and 62-years-old, also the 62 and 63, it is very hard to tell the difference in this map.
 * Visual Clarity: The map does not label the countries with their corresponding retirement ages, forcing the viewer to look back and forth between the map and the color key.
 * Average: It is very hard to compare a country's age and average, since the former is represented by colors on the map, while the latter is represented by numbers.
 * Accessibility: Viewers with color vision deficiencies may not be able to perceive the differences between the colors chosen at all.

**4. Truthfulness: 8/10**
 * Source Credibility: The data is sourced from the OECD, which is generally a reliable and reputable source for economic data, lending credibility to the truthfulness of the
 * Appropriate Precision: The use of color coding to represent different retirement ages seems to be at an appropriate level of precision, given the rounded data
 * Considering these factors, the truthfulness of this visualization could be rated around an 8 out of 10. It appears to accurately and validly represent the data it claims to, albeit with some loss of precision due to rounding and color representation.
   
**5. Intuitiveness: 8/10**
 * Familiarity of Format: The map is a familiar format for presenting geographical data so most viewers are accustomed to seeing maps used in this way.
 * Data Labels: The absence of direct data labels on the map requires viewers to cross-reference with the legend, reducing intuitiveness. Directly labeled maps tend to be more intuitive as they provide immediate understanding.
 * Similar color: The colors used to represent different level of countries are similar, so it is hard for viewers to tell the differences, and it is more harder for colorblind individuals or those with visual impairments.

**6. Aesthetics：9/10**
 * Visual Appeal: The color palette is harmonious, making the map visually pleasing. The design is clean and free from unnecessary clutter, contributing to its visual appeal.
 * Quality of Design: The visualization exhibits a professional level of design. It is well-structured and adheres to a clear color scheme.

**7. Engagement：6/10**
 * Data Accessibility: Although the map provide the data in a colorful way, lack of specific legand and label for each country makes it challenging for audiences to dive into the data. Maybe they just focus on the beautiful picture and design.
 * Visual Hierarchy and Flow: The map does not direct the eye in a manner that encourages exploration. For instance, highlighting outliers or trends could guide viewers to ask why certain countries differ from others.
 * Relevance and Timeliness: The data is from 2020, but the article is for 2023, so I think the less relevance decrease the engagement.


## Step 3: Wireframe A Solution 
### Design 1: Retirement Ages Around World in 2020 for Men and Women
![Retirement Ages Around World in 2020 for Men and Women](https://qinglin0814.github.io/my-picture/assignmen34-1.jpeg)

### Design 2: Average Retirement Ages Around World from 10970 to 2020

## Step 4: Test the solution

### Student, mid 20's
 * **Can you tell me what you think this is?** YES, In the first picture the ages in different countries are shown in a interesting way and in the second picture, the change is shown clealy.
 * **Can you describe to me what this is telling you?** First, most countries have a retirement ages range from 60 to 65. Second, the retirement ages decreased before 2000 but increase after 2000.
 * **Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?** The design way in the first picture is interesting, a line and spots with different size. But it is not that easy for me to find some countries and do some comparison between men and women in the same country. For the second picture, the change is shown in a effectively and clearly way.
 * **Who do you think is the intended audience for this?** Policy makers and some readers who are interested in this topic.
 * **Is there anything you would change or do differently?** Actually, although the design is good, I prefer a table to show all data in a more logical way for the first picture. 


### Adult, mid 50's
 * **Can you tell me what you think this is?** YES, first is to list the retirement ages and the second one is to show the change of retirement ages from 1970 to 2020.
 * **Can you describe to me what this is telling you?** The Japen and New Zealand have the eldest age at 68.2 for men and for women the eldest is 69.2 years old in Indonisia. Most of ages is between 60 to 65.
 * **Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?** For the fist picture, I think it is hard to understand the size of spot at first glance and it needs many eyes' moving to match the label, number and the spot. And the labels are up and down which makes the first picture a bit busy.
 * **Who do you think is the intended audience for this?** Workers in the mentioned countries and social science researchers.
 * **Is there anything you would change or do differently?** Make the label aligned in the first picture. For the second picture, I want to change the scale of the ages-axis. The current one's scale is too large for these data.

* The data visualization is a grid of line graphs comparing retirement ages across various countries to the OECD average over time, specifically from 1970 to 2020. Each cell in the grid represents a different country, with two lines within each cell: one line represents the retirement age for that particular country, while the other (the blue line) represents the OECD average for comparison.
  
* **Why this method is effective:**
 * Comparative Clarity: It allows for an easy comparison of retirement ages across different countries with respect to the OECD average, enabling viewers to quickly identify which countries have higher or lower retirement ages.
 * Trend Analysis: The visualization shows trends over time, making it clear whether retirement ages are increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable in each country.
 * Organization: The grid format is organized and allows for many countries to be displayed at once without overwhelming the viewer, as opposed to a single, cluttered graph.
 * Aesthetic and Design: The use of color coding helps distinguish between the individual countries' data and the OECD average. This color contrast is visually pleasing and aids in readability.
  
* **Something can be better:**
 * Over-Simplification: Each country's retirement age policy might be more complex than a single line can convey, potentially overlooking nuances like different retirement ages based on gender.
 * Missing Data: The note at the bottom states that it only includes countries with data for all decades. This means that countries with incomplete data are excluded, which could skew the overall picture of retirement ages worldwide.
