When selecting a data visualization for critique and redesign, I was drawn to this particular graphic because it represents a wealth of socio-economic data about retirement ages across various European countries, as indicated by the data from the OECD in 2020. The choice of colors to represent different retirement ages is a compelling aspect of the design, as it aims to convey complex data in a straightforward manner. However, this map also presents several opportunities for improvement. The similar hues for adjacent age categories can blend together, potentially causing confusion or misinterpretation of the data. Moreover, the inclusion of the EU-27 average age as a benchmark is useful, but its placement and prominence within the graphic might be optimized for better immediate understanding.

The rationale behind this visualization's critique and subsequent redesign is grounded in enhancing the clarity and accessibility of the information presented. The current design, while informative, may not sufficiently accommodate individuals with color vision deficiencies, and the small distinctions between shades could be lost on many viewers. In the redesign, I aim to address these issues by adopting a more distinct color palette, improving the visual hierarchy, and making the graphic more inclusive and understandable for a wider audience. The goal is to transform this visualization into a more effective tool for policymakers, economists, and the general public to grasp the retirement age landscape across Europe.

**1. Usefulness: 6/10**
  * Data Labels: The map does not provide specific age labels for each country, requiring viewers to cross-reference the color key, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
  * Color Coding: The use of similar shades for consecutive ages makes it difficult to differentiate between them at a glance. This diminishes the map's effectiveness in conveying precise information quickly.
  * This visualization might score around a 6. It presents valuable data but could benefit significantly from design improvements that enhance readability, accessibility, and immediate comprehension.
