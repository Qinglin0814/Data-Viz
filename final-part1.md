# FINAL PROJECT PART 1

## OUTLINE 
**The mind can be sick: Chinese teenagers trapped in the "invisible web"**


**—— Be wary of "The Trouble with Young Werther"**


  * Introduction:
    *  The global incidence of mental disorders among children and adolescents ranges from 12% to 28% and is on the rise. In recent years, Chinese surveys have also found that children and adolescents suffer from mental health problems of varying degrees of severity in about 5-30% of cases, with about 1 in 5 children having a tendency to be depressed. This work focus on the trend and the reason of it.

  * Teenagers are struggling："We are our devils, and we banish ourselves from paradise."
    * In recent years, the problem of adolescents with mental illnesses at a younger age has become increasingly prominent. However, they are more willing to hide their true inner thoughts than to seek help. The inner world of adolescents is filled with all kinds of pressures from society and life as well as unappreciated voices, making them suffer from mental illness.
    * Data viz (plan):
      1. Mental health status of different age groups;
      2. Age statistics of people calling from psychological counseling platforms,
      3. Incidence of depression among adolescents in different regions of China;
      4. Incidence of depression among adolescents in urban and rural areas.

  * Mental health issues deserve public attention: "This is not adolescent rebellion."
    * In this section I would like to emphasize the seriousness of the effects of depression on the patient, to counter the conventional wisdom that "it's just adolescent rebellion", and to show that it is a social problem that deserves attention.
    * Data viz (plan):
      1. Prevalence of several kinds of mental disorders among adolescents;
      2. Characteristics of adolescents with high rates of heart problems;
      3. What are the outward signs of mental disorders in adolescents；
      4. Impact of psychological barriers.

  * The "source" of the problem: "Whatever makes a man happy is often the source of his unhappiness."
    * The problems of children are ultimately the problems of their parents. Broken family relationships fail to give the child complete love, and parents fail to provide the child with the right guidance, instead exacerbating the child's inner loneliness and hatred. In this section I would like to sort out the effects of Chinese family education on teenagers and summarize various types of family of origin problems.
    * Data viz (plan):
      1. Prevalence of various types of family-of-origin problems;
      2. The impact of parents' marital status on children's mental health。

  * Antidote: "When you're consumed by darkness, I'll take your hand."
    * It is not enough to rely solely on the strength of one party to guard the healthy growth of young people, which requires a number of parties to build a psychological defense. In this section, I would like to present how the government, schools, parents and the youth themselves try to solve the mental health problems.
    * Data viz (plan):
      1. Proportion of specialized mental health teachers in urban and rural secondary schools;
      2. Roadmap of policy focusing on teenagers' mental health issue;
      3. Frequency of parent-child communication.

  * Call to action:
    *  Provide public welfare psychological counseling channels: telephone, app, WeChat, social media...
    *  I sincerely hope that every teenagers could healthy and happy, bathing in the sunshine and grow in the spring breeze.
