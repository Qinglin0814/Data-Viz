This is the data viz work I found on the internet and related to the Mental Health topic. I found that:
1. most of them mentioned the rate of depression or mental health.
2. Reginal distribution and gender difference are mentioned a lot.
3. Barchart and pie chart are used most to display the proportion. I think maybe this topic are targeted general public and these two methods of visualization are the easiest way to understand, so using them make the data viz more readable.
4. Most of them use the lovely and active colors like orange, red and yellow.
5. Many work provided many kinds of ways to deal with the mental health problem and provide some really useful and practical advice.


## **User research and interviews**

**1. Chinese Women, 45 years old, a mother of a high school boy**
  * **Why HERï¼š** The primary target audience for this story is parents of high school students. This group is likely to be deeply interested in understanding the signs, impacts, and prevention strategies related to adolescent depression, to better support their children.
  * **Can you tell me a little about your experience as a parent of a high school student?** "It's been a journey of ups and downs. My son is at a stage where he's finding his identity and facing academic and social pressures. I try to support him as much as I can, but sometimes it feels like navigating through a maze without a map."
  * **Have you or anyone you know encountered challenges related to adolescent depression?** "Yes, a friend's daughter went through a tough phase last year. It was an eye-opener for me on how real and close to home adolescent depression can be. It made me realize the importance of being informed and vigilant."
  * **What type of information do you find most valuable when learning about adolescent depression?** "I'm looking for signs to watch out for and practical advice on how to approach my child if I suspect he's struggling. Real-life examples or case studies would be incredibly helpful to understand the nuances."
  * **Are there specific aspects of adolescent depression you are particularly interested in?** "Prevention strategies and how to create a supportive environment at home. I also want to know how to encourage my son to open up about his feelings."
  * **How do you prefer to consume information?** I am not well educated and complex data and graphs are difficult for me to take in, and I think it may be a problem for other parents as well, so I would like to see information that is as simple as possible.
  * **What are your initial thoughts on these visualizations?** The wireframes are a good start, the barchart and piechart are easy to understand for me.
  * **Is there anything you find confusing or unclear?** I am not quite sure whether the policy information and reginal unbalance information are useful for me, I am just a mom and I only care about how I can help my son to avoid mental disorder. But I think they broaden my horizon.
  * **What improvements would you suggest?** You've gone into a lot of detail about the symptoms, which is helpful, but I need more solutions, especially ones that I can use to create a better atmosphere for my son, such as, what way should I talk to my son, and are there any similar surveys that I can use to detect if my son is at risk of mental health problems.


**2. 16-year-old high school boy facing academic pressure**
  * **WHY HIM:** Focusing on a 16-year-old high school boy facing significant academic pressure allows us to directly address the unique challenges and coping needs of adolescents at a critical stage in their mental health journey. This approach not only increases awareness and prevention among youth but also engages them with relatable, impactful content tailored to their preferences and experiences.
  * **Can you tell me a bit about your experience as a high school student?** "It's stressful, honestly. There's a lot of pressure to perform well academically, and it feels like my future depends on every grade. Balancing schoolwork with everything else is really hard."
  * **Have you or anyone you know faced challenges related to mental health or depression?** "I haven't personally, but I know a couple of friends who have struggled. It's not something we talk about much, but I can see how it affects them. It makes me realize how important it is to be aware of these issues."
  * **What type of information do you find most valuable when learning about adolescent depression?** "I'd like to know how to deal with stress and pressure in healthier ways. Tips on managing schoolwork and mental health would be great. Also, knowing when to seek help and where to go would be useful."
  * **Are there specific aspects of adolescent depression you are particularly interested in?** "I'm curious about how stress from school can lead to depression and what can be done to prevent it. Stories from others who've been through it and how they coped or improved their situation would be inspiring."
  * **How do you prefer to consume information?**  "I like short, to-the-point videos and infographics. Anything too long or text-heavy loses my attention. Interactive quizzes or self-assessments could be interesting, too, to see if I'm handling stress well."
  * **Can you give examples of any visualizations or formats that you found particularly effective or engaging in the past?** "I remember this interactive game-like tool in physics class that simulated different stress management techniques. It was engaging and made the information stick."
  * **What do you hope to achieve or learn from visualizations about adolescent depression?**  "I want to learn how to balance things better and not let the pressure get to me. If there are strategies or tools out there that can help, I'm all for it. Also, understanding when it's more than just stress would be important."
  * **What are your initial thoughts on these visualizations?** "They look interesting, but some of the information is a bit dense. Maybe breaking it down into more manageable pieces or using more visuals could help. The design is cool, though. I would appreciate it if you could provide more detailed methods for self-assessment and how to deal with emotion."
  * **Is there anything you find confusing or unclear?** "Some of the terms used are a bit technical like ODD, ADHD. Simplifying the language or providing explanations for terms related to mental health would make it more accessible."
  * **What improvements would you suggest?** "Maybe add more interactive elements or personal stories that I can relate to. Also, a section on how to talk about these issues with friends or family could be really helpful. It's not always easy to bring up."
