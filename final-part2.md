This is the data viz work I found on the internet and related to the Mental Health topic. I found that:
1. most of them mentioned the rate of depression or mental health.
2. Reginal distribution and gender difference are mentioned a lot.
3. Barchart and pie chart are used most to display the proportion. I think maybe this topic are targeted general public and these two methods of visualization are the easiest way to understand, so using them make the data viz more readable.
4. Most of them use the lovely and active colors like orange, red and yellow.
5. Many work provided many kinds of ways to deal with the mental health problem and provide some really useful and practical advice.


## **User research and interviews**

**1. Chinese Women, 45 years old, a mother of a high school boy**
  * **Why HER：** The primary target audience for this story is parents of high school students. This group is likely to be deeply interested in understanding the signs, impacts, and prevention strategies related to adolescent depression, to better support their children.
  * **Can you tell me a little about your experience as a parent of a high school student?** "It's been a journey of ups and downs. My son is at a stage where he's finding his identity and facing academic and social pressures. I try to support him as much as I can, but sometimes it feels like navigating through a maze without a map."
  * **Have you or anyone you know encountered challenges related to adolescent depression?** "Yes, a friend's daughter went through a tough phase last year. It was an eye-opener for me on how real and close to home adolescent depression can be. It made me realize the importance of being informed and vigilant."
  * **What type of information do you find most valuable when learning about adolescent depression?** "I'm looking for signs to watch out for and practical advice on how to approach my child if I suspect he's struggling. Real-life examples or case studies would be incredibly helpful to understand the nuances."
  * **Are there specific aspects of adolescent depression you are particularly interested in?** "Prevention strategies and how to create a supportive environment at home. I also want to know how to encourage my son to open up about his feelings."
  * **How do you prefer to consume information?** I am not well educated and complex data and graphs are difficult for me to take in, and I think it may be a problem for other parents as well, so I would like to see information that is as simple as possible.
  * **What are your initial thoughts on these visualizations?** The wireframes are a good start, the barchart and piechart are easy to understand for me.
  * **Is there anything you find confusing or unclear?** I am not quite sure whether the policy information and reginal unbalance information are useful for me, I am just a mom and I only care about how I can help my son to avoid mental disorder. But I think they broaden my horizon.
  * **What improvements would you suggest?** You've gone into a lot of detail about the symptoms, which is helpful, but I need more solutions, especially ones that I can use to create a better atmosphere for my son, such as, what way should I talk to my son, and are there any similar surveys that I can use to detect if my son is at risk of mental health problems.


**2. 16-year-old high school boy facing academic pressure**
  * **WHY HIM:** Focusing on a 16-year-old high school boy facing significant academic pressure allows us to directly address the unique challenges and coping needs of adolescents at a critical stage in their mental health journey. This approach not only increases awareness and prevention among youth but also engages them with relatable, impactful content tailored to their preferences and experiences.
  * **Can you tell me a bit about your experience as a high school student?** "It's stressful, honestly. There's a lot of pressure to perform well academically, and it feels like my future depends on every grade. Balancing schoolwork with everything else is really hard."
  * **Have you or anyone you know faced challenges related to mental health or depression?** "I haven't personally, but I know a couple of friends who have struggled. It's not something we talk about much, but I can see how it affects them. It makes me realize how important it is to be aware of these issues."
  * **What type of information do you find most valuable when learning about adolescent depression?** "I'd like to know how to deal with stress and pressure in healthier ways. Tips on managing schoolwork and mental health would be great. Also, knowing when to seek help and where to go would be useful."
  * **Are there specific aspects of adolescent depression you are particularly interested in?** "I'm curious about how stress from school can lead to depression and what can be done to prevent it. Stories from others who've been through it and how they coped or improved their situation would be inspiring."
  * **How do you prefer to consume information?**  "I like short, to-the-point videos and infographics. Anything too long or text-heavy loses my attention. Interactive quizzes or self-assessments could be interesting, too, to see if I'm handling stress well."
  * **Can you give examples of any visualizations or formats that you found particularly effective or engaging in the past?** "I remember this interactive game-like tool in physics class that simulated different stress management techniques. It was engaging and made the information stick."
  * **What do you hope to achieve or learn from visualizations about adolescent depression?**  "I want to learn how to balance things better and not let the pressure get to me. If there are strategies or tools out there that can help, I'm all for it. Also, understanding when it's more than just stress would be important."
  * **What are your initial thoughts on these visualizations?** "They look interesting, but some of the information is a bit dense. Maybe breaking it down into more manageable pieces or using more visuals could help. The design is cool, though. I would appreciate it if you could provide more detailed methods for self-assessment and how to deal with emotion."
  * **Is there anything you find confusing or unclear?** "Some of the terms used are a bit technical like ODD, ADHD. Simplifying the language or providing explanations for terms related to mental health would make it more accessible."
  * **What improvements would you suggest?** "Maybe add more interactive elements or personal stories that I can relate to. Also, a section on how to talk about these issues with friends or family could be really helpful. It's not always easy to bring up."


**3. 22-year-old girl who experienced mental disorder in high school**
  * **Can you share a bit about your experience with depression during your middle school years?** "During middle school, I felt overwhelmed by sadness and isolation. It was a time when everything seemed to spiral out of control, and I didn't understand what was happening to me. I struggled in silence for a long time before seeking help."
  * **Looking back, what kind of information or resources do you wish you had access to at that time?** "I wish I had known more about what depression really is, including the signs and symptoms. Information on where to get help and stories of others who had gone through similar experiences and recovered would have made a huge difference. I felt very alone, so knowing there was a way out and that others had walked the same path would have been incredibly comforting."
  * **Do you think the hotlines are helpful for you?** "Maybe, but I think it's more helpful to emphasise that it's normal and not to feel ashamed of being ill. At the time, I remember being afraid to go to the doctor and tell my parents I had depression."
  * **How do you prefer to consume information on topics like mental health now?** "I prefer straightforward, empathetic content that combines personal stories with practical advice. Videos and interactive websites that allow me to engage at my own pace are the most helpful. I also appreciate content that provides tools for self-care and coping strategies."
  * **From your experience, what aspects of adolescent depression should be highlighted to raise awareness and provide support?** "It's crucial to highlight the importance of early intervention and the signs that friends and family can look for. Also, showcasing the reality that depression is a common and treatable condition can help reduce stigma. Practical advice on seeking help, whether it's talking to a counselor or finding support groups, is essential."
  * **Is there anything specific you believe should be included in visualizations about adolescent depression, based on your own experiences?**  "Visualizations should include the spectrum of experiences with depression – it's not the same for everyone. Incorporating interactive elements where viewers can click through to hear personal recovery stories, find resources, or even take self-assessment quizzes could be powerful. Also, visualizing the journey of recovery, including the ups and downs, can provide a more realistic perspective."
  * **Any final thoughts on how to make this information more accessible and engaging for young people?**  "Making sure the content is relatable and doesn't feel like a lecture is key. Using language that resonates with young people, incorporating visuals and interactive elements, and ensuring the platform is mobile-friendly are all important. It's also vital to promote these resources in spaces where young people are, like social media or school programs."
  * **What improvements would you suggest?** “I think you can provide a roadmap to tell the story of how the recovery process is convoluted, but please don't give up. Also, it would be useful if you could provide a **self-assessment scale**. Based on what's out there now I can tell that depression isn't because I'm a freak, it's a common phenomenon and a great concern for society. But I'd also like to see more about **solutions**, such as how exactly parents should relate to their children, how children themselves should de-stress, etc.”


**4. Psychology Major Interested in Adolescent Depression in China**
* **As a psychology student, what draws your interest towards adolescent depression in China specifically?** "I'm intrigued by the unique socio-cultural factors in China that might influence the prevalence and expression of adolescent depression. The **high academic pressure, the one-child policy's legacy, and rapid societal changes** are all factors that could have a profound impact on mental health. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective prevention and treatment strategies."
* **From your studies, how do you think cultural factors influence the understanding and treatment of depression among Chinese adolescents?** "Cultural factors play a significant role in how mental health issues are perceived and treated. In China, there might be a greater stigma attached to mental health problems, leading to underreporting and a reluctance to seek help. Additionally, the emphasis on family honor and success can exacerbate the pressure on young people, potentially contributing to higher rates of depression. Understanding these cultural nuances is essential for creating effective, culturally sensitive interventions."
* **What kind of information do you believe is crucial to include in a data visualization project about this topic?** "It's important to include data on prevalence rates to highlight the scope of the issue. Also, visualizing the socio-cultural factors, access to mental health services, and the impact of interventions can provide a comprehensive overview. Incorporating comparative analysis with other countries might also offer valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by Chinese adolescents."
* **How do you think data visualization can contribute to public awareness and understanding of adolescent depression in China?** "Data visualization can transform complex data into accessible and compelling narratives. By visually presenting the prevalence, causes, and effects of adolescent depression in China, such a project can raise awareness, challenge stigma, and encourage public discourse. It can also highlight gaps in the current support system and push for evidence-based policies and interventions."
* **Is there anything else you want to know?** You mentioned the increase in public attention, which is the part I'm more interested in. For example, what policies are actually geared towards addressing this issue? What does psychoeducation in schools typically consist of? Is there any reflection of family education in China? You summarised the "seven deadly sins", but I would like to see more details.


## **My Take and Improvement Plan**
Across the interviews, several common themes emerged: the need for simple, accessible information; the importance of relatable, personal stories; and the desire for practical solutions and strategies. There's also a clear call for content that addresses the cultural context of adolescent depression in China, indicating the necessity of culturally sensitive approaches.


Based on these insights, the following changes are planned for the visualizations:
 1. Simplify Information: Ensure that all content is easy to understand, avoiding jargon and technical language where possible.
 Enhance Interactivity: Incorporate interactive elements, such as quizzes and clickable stories, to engage users and provide personalized insights.
 2. Focus on Practical Solutions: Shift emphasis towards actionable advice, coping strategies, and how to communicate about mental health issues effectively.
 3. Cultural Sensitivity: Integrate information on the socio-cultural factors specific to China, including how these influence the perception and treatment of adolescent depression.
