This is the data viz work I found on the internet and related to the Mental Health topic. I found that:
1. most of them mentioned the rate of depression or mental health.
2. Reginal distribution and gender difference are mentioned a lot.
3. Barchart and pie chart are used most to display the proportion. I think maybe this topic are targeted general public and these two methods of visualization are the easiest way to understand, so using them make the data viz more readable.
4. Most of them use the lovely and active colors like orange, red and yellow.
5. Many work provided many kinds of ways to deal with the mental health problem and provide some really useful and practical advice.
