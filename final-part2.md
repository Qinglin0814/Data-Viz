This is the data viz work I found on the internet and related to the Mental Health topic. I found that:
1. most of them mentioned the rate of depression or mental health.
2. Reginal distribution and gender difference are mentioned a lot.
3. Barchart and pie chart are used most to display the proportion. I think maybe this topic are targeted general public and these two methods of visualization are the easiest way to understand, so using them make the data viz more readable.
4. Most of them use the lovely and active colors like orange, red and yellow.
5. Many work provided many kinds of ways to deal with the mental health problem and provide some really useful and practical advice.


## **User research and interviews**

**1. Chinese Women, 45 years old, a mother of a high school boy**
  * Why HERï¼š The primary target audience for this story is parents of high school students. This group is likely to be deeply interested in understanding the signs, impacts, and prevention strategies related to adolescent depression, to better support their children.
  * **Can you tell me a little about your experience as a parent of a high school student?** "It's been a journey of ups and downs. My son is at a stage where he's finding his identity and facing academic and social pressures. I try to support him as much as I can, but sometimes it feels like navigating through a maze without a map."
  * **Have you or anyone you know encountered challenges related to adolescent depression?** "Yes, a friend's daughter went through a tough phase last year. It was an eye-opener for me on how real and close to home adolescent depression can be. It made me realize the importance of being informed and vigilant."
  * **What type of information do you find most valuable when learning about adolescent depression?** "I'm looking for signs to watch out for and practical advice on how to approach my child if I suspect he's struggling. Real-life examples or case studies would be incredibly helpful to understand the nuances."
  * **Are there specific aspects of adolescent depression you are particularly interested in?** "Prevention strategies and how to create a supportive environment at home. I also want to know how to encourage my son to open up about his feelings."
  * **How do you prefer to consume information?** I am not well educated and complex data and graphs are difficult for me to take in, and I think it may be a problem for other parents as well, so I would like to see information that is as simple as possible.
  * **What are your initial thoughts on these visualizations?** The wireframes are a good start, the barchart and piechart are easy to understand for me.
  * **Is there anything you find confusing or unclear?** I am not quite sure whether the policy information and reginal unbalance information are useful for me, I am just a mom and I only care about how I can help my son to avoid mental disorder. But I think they broaden my horizon.
  * **What improvements would you suggest?** You've gone into a lot of detail about the symptoms, which is helpful, but I need more solutions, especially ones that I can use to create a better atmosphere for my son, such as, what way should I talk to my son, and are there any similar surveys that I can use to detect if my son is at risk of mental health problems.
