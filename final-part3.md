# Part III: Final project and presentation

## Target Audience Analysis

Since completing Part II of my project, I've made several pivotal changes to my final data story on the topic of adolescent depression in China. The most significant shift was in my audience targeting strategy. Initially, I considered including teenagers themselves as part of my primary audience. **However, after deep reflection and analysis, I decided to focus exclusively on adults who play influential roles in teenagers' lives: parents, teachers, educators, and policy makers.** This decision was driven by insights gathered from interviews and my research, which highlighted a crucial gap in awareness and understanding of adolescent depression among these key stakeholders. By directing the narrative towards them, I aim to foster a supportive environment that can effectively address and mitigate the challenges faced by teenagers dealing with depression.

To tailor my project for this audience, I made specific adjustments to the content and presentation. Recognizing the complexity of the subject and the diverse backgrounds of my audience, **I simplified medical jargon, focusing instead on conveying practical information and actionable advice**. This approach was designed to demystify the topic and **make the information more accessible and actionable for non-medical professionals**. I incorporated real-life scenarios and testimonials to create a more relatable and engaging narrative. This decision was based on feedback from preliminary user research, which suggested that personal stories could significantly enhance comprehension and empathy.

In redesigning the project on adolescent depression in China, I chose simple yet effective visualizations—bar charts, pie charts, and road maps—for their clarity and accessibility, ensuring that the complex topic is easily understood by parents, teachers, and policymakers. The use of a dark theme mirrors the serious nature of depression, with strategic highlights in yellow and orange to draw attention to key insights, symbolizing crucial points of understanding and action. The narrative culminates in a brighter color scheme for the call to action, intentionally shifting from darkness to light to evoke hope and inspire positive steps forward. This design strategy not only aids in comprehension but also embarks the audience on an emotional journey from awareness to empowerment.

**Reflecting on this process, one of the key lessons I learned is the importance of audience-centered storytelling.** I originally planned to use trendy, complex icons and interactive designs, but the parents I interviewed said that these pictures were too complicated to receive information directly and quickly, so I simplified it. At the same time, I joined online communities, volunteers, depression self-examination platforms, etc. to respond to the needs of the audience during interviews. Adapting narrative and presentation to meet the specific needs and preferences of your target audience can be a challenging yet rewarding experience. It highlights the need for empathy and understanding when creating effective and impactful data stories.

## Charting New Territories: My Whirlwind Journey Through Data Storytelling and Tableau

Oh, where do I even begin? 🌟 Learning to tell stories with data and mastering Tableau has been an adventure—a blend of "Eureka!" moments and "What am I even looking at?" kinds of days. So, here is a little journey through the rollercoaster ride of my data storytelling expedition. Buckle up! 🎢

* The Starting Line 🏁
It all began with an innocent curiosity about data visualization. I heard maybe thousands of times that people talking about data visualization and tableau as something very fancy. But I never use it. "How hard can it be?" I thought. Famous last words, right? My first encounter with Tableau felt like walking into a party where everyone spoke a language I didn't know. But hey, I was determined to join the conversation. 🎉

* The "Aha!" Moments 🤩
Gradually, as I tinkered around, those baffling charts and perplexing numbers started making sense. I learned that a well-crafted chart could speak a thousand words. With every bar, line, and pie (mmm, pie 🥧), I found myself getting better at turning raw numbers into compelling narratives.

* The Challenges 🤯
But it wasn't all smooth sailing. There were times when I felt like I was trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. Dataset, sometime it is so hard for me to find the right one. Once you find one, you have to do the data cleaning. There always are so many NULL and missing data in a dataset. And finding the right visualization for my data was sometimes like looking for a needle in a haystack. And let's not even talk about those moments that have no idea every function in Tableau about. Try, try again, and mess it up. Oh, the drama! 🎭

* The Takeaways 📚
What have I learned from all this? Well, for starters, that data is a powerful storyteller. With the right tools and a bit of creativity, it can reveal trends, patterns, and stories that might otherwise remain hidden. And Tableau? It's like a magic wand for data visualization—once you learn how to wield it. By the way, I love the flourish.com and I recommend it to several classmates which is straight forward to use and the default color set are more lovely than tableau...

* The Future 🔮
Looking ahead, I'm excited to dive even deeper into the world of data storytelling. There are so many more charts to explore, dashboards to design, and data-driven stories to tell. I plan to make next data visualization work based on the Manchester City Football Club and the Kevin De Bruyne (personal intersts✨) The journey has just begun, and I can't wait to see where it takes me. 🚀

Happy charting, everyone!
