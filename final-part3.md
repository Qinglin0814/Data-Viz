# Part III: Final project and presentation

## Target Audience Analysis

Since completing Part II of my project, I've made several pivotal changes to my final data story on the topic of adolescent depression in China. The most significant shift was in my audience targeting strategy. Initially, I considered including teenagers themselves as part of my primary audience. However, after deep reflection and analysis, I decided to focus exclusively on adults who play influential roles in teenagers' lives: parents, teachers, educators, and policy makers. This decision was driven by insights gathered from interviews and my research, which highlighted a crucial gap in awareness and understanding of adolescent depression among these key stakeholders. By directing the narrative towards them, I aim to foster a supportive environment that can effectively address and mitigate the challenges faced by teenagers dealing with depression.
